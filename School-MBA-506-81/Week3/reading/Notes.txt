According to the PMBOK, a risk is an uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs, has a positive or negative effect on one or more project objectives (PMBOK, 2017).

Uncertainty exists when the information is not absolute or complete. 

The key distinction between risks and issues is uncertainty. 

The source of risk can come from the project’s constraints as well as from the environment surrounding and within the project.

Once a risk or issue has been identified and analyzed for its probability of occurrence and impact severity, we need to plan a response.
Types: Accept, Transfer, Avoid, Mitigate

Contingency reserve - held at the project level and set aside for known-unknowns (i.e. the risks) that have been identified and are recorded in the risk register.

Management reserve - held at the larger organizational level within which the project exists. 

As we identify stakeholders, we can assign them to categories such as Internal/External and Customer/Non-Customer.

we can consider qualifications to indicate the stakeholder’s attitude towards the project. Are they a supporter, bystander, driver or blocker?
