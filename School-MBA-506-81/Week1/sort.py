sorted_data is a list of lists, where each inner list is a sorted version of the original sets.

sorted(sorted_data, key=lambda x: ...) sorts the list of lists sorted_data using the provided key function, which takes one argument x and returns a value to be used for comparison during the sorting process. In this case, x is each inner sorted list (i.e., each sorted set).

itertools.chain(x, [float('-inf')] * (1 - len(x))) is used to create a new iterable, where elements from x are followed by elements from [float('-inf')] * (1 - len(x)). In this case, x is an inner sorted list (i.e., a sorted set).

[float('-inf')] * (1 - len(x)) creates a list with 1 - len(x) occurrences of the value float('-inf'). This is done to ensure that empty sets are sorted to the beginning of the sorted_data list.

For non-empty sets, 1 - len(x) will be 0, so the list [float('-inf')] * (1 - len(x)) will be empty, and itertools.chain(x, [float('-inf')] * (1 - len(x))) will effectively just return x.

For empty sets, 1 - len(x) will be 1, so the list [float('-inf')] * (1 - len(x)) will have one element: float('-inf'). Therefore, itertools.chain(x, [float('-inf')] * (1 - len(x))) will return a new iterable with one element: float('-inf'). This ensures that empty sets are sorted to the beginning of the list because float('-inf') is smaller than any other number.

list(itertools.chain(x, [float('-inf')] * (1 - len(x)))) converts the iterable created by itertools.chain() back to a list. This list will be used as the key for comparison during the sorting process.

In summary, this line of code sorts the sorted_data list of lists based on the elements of each inner sorted list in lexicographical order, with empty sets sorted to the beginning of the list.
