Viewing change as an ongoing process rather than a fixed endpoint helps organizations remain flexible and better navigate complexity.
VUCA environment, where uncertainty and volatility dominate, allows organizations to embrace multiple perspectives.

I would agree with you when you said, "there is a large variety of perspectives that may or may not agree with each other."  There was a preacher that told me once the only paster he knew that he agreed with 100 percent was himself.  It is easy to make that a negative to yourself, where you don't take input from other people.  While at the same time acknowledge two people come from differnt backgrounds and in certain areas will not see eye to eye.

You pointed out that organizations change over time that they re-create themselves.  I would be careful when a company wants to pivot to something they don't know, but it looks like you are suggesting their image is changed is that right?  If so I can see a company updating its advertising to new technology and people groups they are pitching their product to.  Did you have any examples in mind when you were talking about this point?

You said, "The words, metaphors, and symbols organizations use will shape their understanding and response to volatility."
I was initally opposed to this, but after hearing your thoughts it makes sense.  Often in email it is compllicated to get subtle messages accross and in some cases you can sound hostile when that wasn't your inition.  From what you wrote I can see how observing these traits and adapting can lead to a positive outcome.
